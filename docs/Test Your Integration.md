# Test Your Integration

Make sure that you've complete the previous steps on SDK integration prior to testing.

## Step 1: Debug Mode

Test ads with either **Android Emulator** or **iOS Simulator** at this stage.

If everything's done correctly you should be able to display ads with **Test mode** label, for example:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/nextmillenniummedia/next-sdk-flutter-example/blob/main/docs/images/test_ads_banner.png" height="480">
</p>

For the next step you'll be required to enable a flag when initialize SDK which would signal SDK to serve test ads while in **Release** build.

Enabling a flag is required, since if we don't get a signal we won't be able to serve test ads on each request made.

```dart
await NextSdk().initialize(onTestMode: true);
```

**Important**: For iOS 14+ you need also give access to IDFA so we can generate device ID based on it. We recommend you to use [app_tracking_transparency](https://pub.dev/packages/app_tracking_transparency) library. Or you can do it by your custom way.

Once done, you are encouraged to publish your app to **App Tester / TestFlight** for further internal testing.

## Step 2: App Tester / TestFlight

### App-ads.txt

By the time testing, `app-ads.txt` **must** be added into your developer website, for example: `example.com/app-ads.txt`

Please, contact your account manager (*support@nextmillennium.io*) so you'll be provided with a proper file to add.

This step is a **must** to start displaying ads.

### Test Integrated Ad Units

Just as in **Debug Mode** you should be able to see 100% of the implemented ads in your application with a **Test mode** label, however now you'll be able to test ads on physical devices.

If something's not working for you at this stage, don't hesitate and contact our support team.

Once you're sure that everything works as intended make sure to disable the test flag before the app release on SDK initialization:

```dart
await NextSdk().initialize(onTestMode: false);
```

## Step 3: Play Store / App Store

Once your ad is released keep researching for better spots for your ads.
